Use of uncertainty of measurement for decisions on conformity (decision rule) :
No decision rule is specified by the IEC standard, when comparing the measurement result with the applicable limit according to the specification in that standard. The decisions on conformity are made without applying the measurement uncertainty (“simple acceptance” decision rule, previously known as “accuracy method”).
Other:… (to be specified, for example when required by the standard or client, or if national accreditation requirements apply)
Information on uncertainty of measurement:
The uncertainties of measurement are calculated by the laboratory based on application of criteria given by OD-5014 for test equipment and application of test methods, decision sheets and operational procedures of IECEE.
IEC Guide 115 provides guidance on the application of measurement uncertainty principles and applying the decision rule when reporting test results within IECEE scheme, noting that the reporting of the measurement uncertainty for measurements is not necessary unless required by the test standard or customer.
Calculations leading to the reported values are on file with the NCB and testing laboratory that conducted the testing.

The equipment intended to be used up to 5000m above sea level, the factor (1.48) given in table 16 of IEC 62368-1 was considered.
5.
This AC POWER SUPPLY maximum continuous output power is 33W. The AC POWER SUPPLY working load with 20.0VDC, 3.0A for 5 minutes, then reduced to 20.0VDC, 2.25A for 5 minutes, then
reduced to 20.0VDC, 1.67A for long working; or working load with 15.0VDC, 3.0A for 10 minutes, then reduced to 15.0VDC, 2.2A for long working; or load with 11.0VDC, 3.0A for long working. The other outputs could with normal maximum load condition, refer to appended table 5.4.1.4, 9.3, B.1.5, B.2.6 for details.
6.
Except for quick charge, USB-C output is 5Vdc only.
