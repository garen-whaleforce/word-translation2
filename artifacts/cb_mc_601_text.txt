Summary of compliance with National Differences (List of countries addressed): 
Canada and United States, JAPAN 
The product fulfils the requirements of UL 62368-1:2019. 
The product fulfils the requirements of CAN/CSA C22.2 No. 62368-1-19. 
The product fulfils the requirements of J62368-1(2023). 
Use of uncertainty of measurement for decisions on conformity (decision rule) : 
No decision rule is specified by the IEC standard, when comparing the measurement result with the applicable limit according to the specification in that standard. The decisions on conformity are made without applying the measurement uncertainty (“simple acceptance” decision rule, previously known as “accuracy method”). 
Other:… (to be specified, for example when required by the standard or client, or if national accreditation requirements apply) 
Information on uncertainty of measurement: 
The uncertainties of measurement are calculated by the laboratory based on application of criteria given by OD-5014 for test equipment and application of test methods, decision sheets and operational procedures of IECEE. 
IEC Guide 115 provides guidance on the application of measurement uncertainty principles and applying the decision rule when reporting test results within IECEE scheme, noting that the reporting of the measurement uncertainty for measurements is not necessary unless required by the test standard or customer. 
Calculations leading to the reported values are on file with the NCB and testing laboratory that conducted the testing.

Note 1: Tma should be considered as directed by appliable requirement 
Note 2: Tma is not included in assessment of Touch Temperatures (Clause 9) 
1. 
The temperatures were measured under worst case normal mode and as described in B.2.5 at voltages as above. 
2. 
With a specified maximum ambient temperature and test temperature of 45°C, the maximum permitted temperatures are calculated as follows: T1 Winding components (providing safety isolation): Class 130 (B)  Tmax = 120°C - 10°C = 110°C. 
3. 
Horizontal means the adaptor is plugged into horizontal socket-outlet; Vertical means the adaptor is plugged into vertical wall socket-outlet.
